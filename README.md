A **To-Do List App** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) allows users to manage tasks efficiently by adding, editing, marking as complete/incomplete, and deleting tasks. The React.js frontend provides a responsive UI, while the backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handles API calls for seamless interaction with the MongoDB database. This project demonstrates the integration of the MERN stack for creating a simple, functional, and dynamic web application.
